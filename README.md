# 📞 PWC Call Center Dashboard - Power BI  

## 📌 Overview  
This repository contains a **Power BI dashboard** designed to analyze and visualize call center performance metrics. The dashboard provides key insights into **customer satisfaction, agent performance, call resolution rates, and response times** to help improve efficiency and decision-making.  

## 📊 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)  

1. **Overall Customer Satisfaction**  
   - This metric represents the average satisfaction rating provided by customers after each call. It helps evaluate overall service quality and identify areas for improvement.  

2. **Overall Calls Answered & Abandoned**  
   - The dashboard tracks the total number of calls answered versus those that were abandoned. Understanding these trends helps optimize staffing and reduce abandoned calls.  

3. **Calls by Time**  
   - This visualization shows the distribution of calls throughout the day, highlighting peak hours when the call center receives the highest volume of inquiries.  

4. **Average Speed of Answer**  
   - This KPI measures the average time taken for agents to answer incoming calls. A lower speed of answer indicates better efficiency, while higher times may suggest staffing or training gaps.  

5. **Agent Performance Quadrant (Avg Talk Duration vs Calls Answered)**  
   - This analysis compares agents based on the number of calls they answer and the average duration of their conversations. It helps in identifying high-performing agents and those who may need coaching.  

6. **Call Resolution Rate**  
   - This metric tracks the percentage of calls that were successfully resolved. A higher resolution rate indicates better customer support, while a lower rate may require process improvements.  

7. **Calls Over Time**  
   - The dashboard presents call trends over a selected period, allowing users to observe fluctuations in call volume and detect seasonal patterns.  

8. **Top Performing Agents**  
   - A comparison of agents based on the number of calls handled, resolution rate, and customer satisfaction. This helps recognize top performers and guide training efforts for underperforming agents.
